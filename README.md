# python_code
this repo is for saving useful code pieces I've used. May be useful again at some point.

1. PyPDF2.py and pdfminer.py. For PDF doc extractions. 

2. Sendig data from local repo to a SFTP server on AWS Transfer Family: SFTPfilesend.py. Very useful for Automation

3. If you need to edit a PDF: PDF_editor.py
